# Hangman `100pts Total`

<br>

### Instructions: `(30pts)`
* Create `Hangman.py` in this folder.
* Define a function for each objective.
* Document every line of the code.


<br>

## Select a random word. `(5pts)`
You may select a random word by one of 2 ways:
1. Create a list with at least 20 words and use `random()`
2. Fetch a random Word from an API. This may be done by using the *HTTP Request deserialization* code used in `Web-Servers`.

Print out it's length represented by underscores:

eg. MAGISTERIO
``` 
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
```

<br>

## Create a multiline string array for each step of the game. `(5pts)`
```python
steps = [
        """
        1
        """,
        """
        2
        """]
```

<br>

## Validate input `(10pts)`
Accept a single character from the user as input. You must ensure to receive a valid character.
* A single character long
* Not a number
* Not a symbol
* User has not attempted the letter already.
  * Create a list to store attempted characters
* Must handle lower case and upper case letters.

<br>

## Find matches in your word. `(10pts)`
Print out underscores combined with successfully matched characters.
``` 
M _ G _ S _ E _ I _
```

<br>

## Display the current step of the game by addressing it's index of the array. `(10pts)`
You must develop a mechanism to keep track of which step you're on base of failed attempts.
```python
# Example of printing the fist step in hangman.
print(steps[0])
```

<br>

## To-Do:
1. Display attempted letters List. `(10pts)`
2. Logic for game progression.`(10pts)`
3. Loop to restart game. `(5pts)`
