#DISCLAIMER: This code might take some time to load at first, as well as take time to restart.

#RULES: A Hangman game will be presented to you, and the goal is to slowly type letters until you are able to figure out which word (crypto) is the true one. If a correct letter is typed, the hangman will remain static. If an incorrect letter is typed, the hangman will slowly be hung limb by limb, so be careful. 

#NOTES: If you win, the restart will work as intended, but for some reason whenever the hangman reaches the final stage in his execution, it doesn't end. So in order for it to end properly in a losing situation, you shall have to type an extra letter for it to proceed as normal. 

#This code prevents error, although it is not recommended to use or necessary.

#Here I create a function in order to acquire my word from random data in an api. I first start the function by using def, declaring the function. I then simply added getWord as a function name and then I added the parenthesis, and closed it with a colon.

And after my previous line of code "read" the website, it already knows that RandomCryptoCoin exists and I then request a word from inside the RandomCryptoCoin.
